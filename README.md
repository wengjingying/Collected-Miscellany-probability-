# Collected-Miscellany-probability-
A bunch of topic I am interested

## In progress:

### Hometask (temp name): 

Question 1: Given a length 4 vector V, and two numbers N<M, what is the probability to find two components a and b from V that a>=N and b>=M (task 1).

Question 2ï¼šGiven another length 4 vector E, only one component of E can be used to be added to the corresponding position of V to fullfill task 1. What is the probability now (task 2).

Question 3: Given a list of 4 vectors V0, get the max sum for each vector as the vector V for Question 1. Each sum can used up to 2 components.

Question 4: Given V0 and E, get the max sum of each vector as sum of the V0 vector and the corresponding E component, can only use up to 1 component in E and up to 4 component in V0.

Question 5: Given V0 and E, what is the minumum value to be add to which component in V0 or E to fullfill a certain probability in task 2.


## To do:

### 1: Gatch system:

Basic question (Q1): Given probabilities of pulling a set consisted of 1 weapon and 3 equipment (top, medium, bottom), some garanteed rules, how many pulls are expected to have the set.

Q2: Adding Rule 1: Two equipment in the same position can be exchanged to one equipment didn't have yet if the other two are obtained. What is the expected pulling number now.

Q3: Adding Rule 2: One rare item is garanteed in every 10 pulls, it is possibly be something other than that set. What is the expected pulling number now.

Q4: Adding Rule 3: One unobtained item in that set is garanteed in every 50 pulls. What is the expected pulling number now.

Q5: Plot of probability, garanteed value vs the expected pulls. The distribution of pulls.


### 2: A network of combat

Q1: Given a list of teams with different acquired abilities and a list of bosses with desired abilities, calculate the fullfilled number and proportion.

Q2: Add influence factors as penalty or bonus scores for the team

Q3: Feed data and train a predictive model.


### 3: Factorial figures

### 4: Weapon question

Q1: a new weapon comes with an old weapon, possibly be the one you don't have. You have P1 chance to get the new weapon without the old one and P2 chance to get both of them. The one you got became the old weapons in the future pulls. What are P1 and P2.

Q2: The chance to have an old weapon you have (P3) or don't have (P4) in a new pull

Q3: The chance to have both old weapon in a new pull

Q4: If you only pull when both weapons you don't have, what is the expected pulls to collect them all (or with one left)
