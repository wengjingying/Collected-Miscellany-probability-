# Collected-Miscellany-probability-
A bunch of topic I am interested

In progress:
Hometask (temp name): 
Question 1: Given a length 4 vector V, and two numbers N<M, what is the probability to find two components a and b from V that a>=N and b>=M (task 1).
Question 2ï¼šGiven another length 4 vector E, only one component of E can be used to be added to the corresponding position of V to fullfill task 1. What is the probability now (task 2).
Question 3: Given a list of 4 vectors V0, get the max sum for each vector as the vector V for Question 1. Each sum can used up to 2 components.
Question 4: Given V0 and E, get the max sum of each vector as sum of the V0 vector and the corresponding E component, can only use up to 1 component in E and up to 4 component in V0.
Question 5: Given V0 and E, what is the minumum value to be add to which component in V0 or E to fullfill a certain probability in task 2.
