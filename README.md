# Collected-Miscellany-probability-
A bunch of topic I am interested

## In progress:

### Hometask (temp name): 

Question 1: Given a length 4 vector V, and two numbers N<M, what is the probability to find two components a and b from V that a>=N and b>=M (task 1).

Question 2：Given another length 4 vector E, only one component of E can be used to be added to the corresponding position of V to fullfill task 1. What is the probability now (task 2).

Question 3: Given a list of 4 vectors V0, get the max sum for each vector as the vector V for Question 1. Each sum can used up to 2 components.

Question 4: Given V0 and E, get the max sum of each vector as sum of the V0 vector and the corresponding E component, can only use up to 1 component in E and up to 4 component in V0.

Question 5: Given V0 and E, what is the minumum value to be add to which component in V0 or E to fullfill a certain probability in task 2.


## To do:

### 1: Gatch system:

Basic question (Q1): Given probabilities of pulling a set consisted of 1 weapon and 3 equipment (top, medium, bottom), some garanteed rules, how many pulls are expected to have the set.

Q2: Adding Rule 1: Two equipment in the same position can be exchanged to one equipment didn't have yet if the other two are obtained. What is the expected pulling number now.

Q3: Adding Rule 2: One rare item is garanteed in every 10 pulls, it is possibly be something other than that set. What is the expected pulling number now.

Q4: Adding Rule 3: One unobtained item in that set is garanteed in every 50 pulls. What is the expected pulling number now.

Q5: What if stopped with uncompleted set, how much pulls will be to continue again without memory.

Q6: Plot of probability, garanteed value vs the expected pulls. The distribution of pulls.


### 2: A network of combat

Q1: Given a list of teams with different acquired abilities and a list of bosses with desired abilities, calculate the fullfilled number and proportion.

Q2: Add influence factors as penalty or bonus scores for the team

Q3: Feed data and train a predictive model.


### 3: Factorial figures

### 4：PVP

Suppose one player had a certain chance of being the top 3 (P1) in lv2 or top 10 (P2) in lv1 pvp arena (abyss). Being top 3 in LV2 plus 100 credit, being top 10 in LV2 (P1b) has no change in credit. Being top 3 in LV1 add 100 credit (P2b), top 10 no change, but bottom 10 minus 200 credit (1-P2). 
P could be considered as the proportion of optimizd teams for each boss one player has (with added bonus like skills, SS and homeland levels)

Variables: P and credit change.

Q1: Given certain Ps,

Q2: Find Ps to maximize the times remain in LV1 (or back to LV1).
